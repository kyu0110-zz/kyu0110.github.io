Effect of spatial resolution on transport processes in a chemical transport model
GEOS-Chem is driven by assimilated meteorological fields from the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 (GEOS-5), which is produced at a native resolution of 0.25x0.3125 degree. Averaging high resolution meteorological fields to drive global GEOS-Chem (2x2.5 or 4x5 degree resolution) leads to reduced vertical transport. I am working to quantify these biases, understand how different pathways are affected by the averaging of subgrid scale information and how transport and removal processes are coupled and affected by grid resolution, and develop a computationally efficient method of reducing these biases. <br>

Sensitivity to grid resolution in the ability of a chemical transport model to simulate observed oxidant chemistry under high-isoprene conditions<br>
The inability to resolve subgrid scale processes has been shown to lead to biases in chemical transport models (CTMs). Increasing the spatial resolution of a chemical transport model may improve simulations but can be computationally expensive. Using observations from the SEAC4RS aircraft campaign, we evaluate the effect of chemical non-linearity on the ability of a CTM to simulate the chemical interactions in the Southeast US, a region of high isoprene emissions. We find that at higher spatial resolutions, models are better able to simulate the chemical pathways of ozone precursors, but the overall effect on regional mean concentrations is small. This implies that for regional boundary layer applications, coarse resolution models are adequate.

SEAC4RS was an aircraft campaign based in Houston, TX that took place Aug-Sept 2013. Two aircraft were used to study the North American Monsoon, forest fires, Southeast US air chemistry, and hurricanes. Related papers from the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group:
