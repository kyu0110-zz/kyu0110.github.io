    <p>I grew up beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, surrounded by the oceans and the mountains. I was born in China but immigrated with my family as a child. After high school, I atttend Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I studied Civil and Environmental Engineering. Although I was not exposed to programming in high school, at CMU I learned to program and it sparked an interest in technology. In graduate school, I tried to combine my interest in computational modeling with environmental problems by joining the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group and working on model development for the GEOS-Chem Chemical Transport Model.</p>

    <p>Although not one of my research goals, I am also interested in learning more about how science can inform policy. To that end, I hope to become better at communicating science, and am always interested in meeting people in other disciplines who study environmental problems. </p>
    <p>I enjoy hiking, climbing, and generally spending time outdoors. The Earth and Planetary Sciences Department at Harvard is generous enough to send its graduate students on a field trip every summer. I have gone with them to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and to the Southwest. </p>
    <p>After graduate school, I began working as a data scientist at TiVo, building models and analytics tools to gain insight into television viewership. Now I work at Lyft, where I am very excited to contribute to the company's mission of improving people's lives with the world's best transportation. </p>
